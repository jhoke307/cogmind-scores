# cogmind-scores

A set of Clojure functions to analyze Cogmind score data in Protobuf
format.

For more on Cogmind, see https://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/

I've done this as a fun way to learn Clojure; don't expect too much.

## Usage

What you'll need:

1. [Leinengen](https://leiningen.org/#install)
2. The protobuf definition from https://github.com/Kyzrati/cogmind-scoresheet
copied into resources/protobuf/scoresheet.proto
3. Score data (you'll have to ask Kyzrati for this)

Compile the protobuf definition with:

```
protoc -I resources/proto \
	resources/proto/scoresheet.proto \
	resources/proto/archived_scoresheet.proto \
	 --java_out .
```

Then run it:

```
lein run -- -d score-data-directory leaders 100
```
