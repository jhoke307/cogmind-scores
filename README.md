# cogmind-scores

A set of Clojure functions to analyze Cogmind score data in Protobuf
format.

For more on Cogmind, see https://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/

This is a fan project and not sponsored by or affiliated with Grid Sage
Games / Josh Ge. Any opinions represented here are my own.

I've done this as a fun way to learn Clojure; don't expect too much.

## Usage

What you'll need:

1. protoc
2. [Leinengen](https://leiningen.org/#install)
3. Score data (you'll have to ask Kyzrati for this)

Set the path to protoc in project.clj if it's not `/usr/bin/protoc`.

Then run main:

```
lein run -- -d score-data-directory leaders 100
```

Or run the REPL and experiment.

```
lein repl
```
